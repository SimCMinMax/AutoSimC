Edit the simcraft-path in settings.py to point to your simc-installation. The result.html will be saved in results-subfolder.There are 2 modes available for calculating the possible huge amount of permutations: Static and dynamic mode:* Static uses a fixed amount of simc-iterations at the cost of quality; default-settings are 100, 1000 and 10000 for each stage.* Dynamic mode lets you set the target_error-parameter from simc, resulting in a more accurate ranking. Stage 1 can be entered at the beginning in the wizard. Stage 2 is set to target_error=0.2, and 0.05 for the final stage 3.(These numbers might be changed in future versions)You have to set the simc path in the settings.py file.- Resuming: It is also possible to resume at a stage, e.g. if simc.exe crashed during stage1, by launching with the parameter -sim stage1 (or stage2/3).- Parallel Processing: By default multiple simc-instances are launched for stage1 and 2, which is a major speedup on modern multicore-cpus like AMD Ryzen. If you encounter problems or instabilities, edit settings.py and change the corresponding parameters or even disable it."

"Enables permutation of gem-combinations in your gear. With e.g. gems crit,haste,int you can add all combinations of the corresponding gems (epic gems: 200, rare: 150, uncommon greens are not supported) in addition to the ones you have currently equipped.\n"
"Valid gems: {}- Example: You have equipped 1 int and 2 mastery-gems. If you enter <-gems \"crit,haste,int\"> (without <>) into the commandline, the permutation process uses the single int- and mastery-gem-combination you have currrently equipped and adds ALL combinations from the ones in the commandline, therefore mastery would be excluded. However, adding mastery to the commandline reenables that.\n"
"- Gems have to fulfil the following syntax in your profile: gem_id=123456[[/234567]/345678] Simpermut usually creates this for you.\n"
"- WARNING: If you have many items with sockets and/or use a vast gem-combination-setup as command, the number of combinations will go through the roof VERY quickly. Please be cautious when enabling this.- additonally you can specify a empty list of gems, which will permutate the existing gemsin your input gear."
